TODO: 1. water sounds for waterfall + my dialogues (im thankful for all the help :D)
#2.last checkup, if not satisfied we can talk about it (touch-ups if you want)
#3. maybe a break and you can announce anytime to start cafe

#if we ever want to do releases for the submod:
#here are some of my ideas,
#1. codes clean up, thinking of using define just like extra plus main
#example: define complies = [
    #"Great.",
    #"Keep it up, [player]!",
    #"Good.",
    #"Amazing, [player]!",
    #]

#2. more topics if we have to and if we have ideas
#3. interactive areas if we want

#ps. i have school starting from september
